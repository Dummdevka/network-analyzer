# ML based network analyzer

This tool is designed to detect various vulnerabilities and attacks in your network communications and send real-time notifications to your Splunk admin panel. The analysis is powered by machine learning models and is performed in real time. This project was developed as a thesis for a bachelor's degree.

## Config file

For the tool to function correctly, you need to create a **config.cfg** file in the same directory as the **main.py** script. An example configuration file **(example-config.cfg)** can be found in the repository for reference.
